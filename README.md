# Verbatim

The purpose of Verbatim is to automate the extraction of text from PDF and then generate podcasts. This is because I want to be able to consume more academic research without having to read it, but much academic and scholarly work is contained within PDFs. 

My intention is that the fully ralised version of this project will include machine learning models at several points to aid automation:
1. Intelligence document processing - recognise and label text elements within a document
2. Optical character recognition - extract text
3. Speech to Text - convert extracted text into audio files of spoken words

### Approach

The project currently consists of Phase 1
